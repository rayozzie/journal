                    <tD  VALIGN=TOP HEIGHT= 866  WIDTH="333"><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">It seemed we always had a pet around the Fischer house - either cats or a dog, a yellow canary, or painted turtles from Woolworth's dime store.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Mitzie is the only cat I can remember. &nbsp;When we were four or five years old, Grandpa built a large sandbox under the back porch at Lakewood Avenue for my cousin, Marion and me. &nbsp;We would always carefully watch for Mitzie so she didn't mess in our sandbox.!</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Mitzie would have kittens every time she could, so there'd be plenty of kittens around. &nbsp;That is, of course, until Grandma became tired of it and began giving kittens away.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">After Mitzie, in the 1930s, we owned a dog named Prince. &nbsp;Prince was a &quot;watch dog&quot; - he barked at everyone passing by and roamed the neighborhood with other dogs. &nbsp;(Those were the days before dogs had to be licensed and kept inside.) &nbsp;Prince often growled at us and seemed bad tempered. &nbsp;&nbsp;We eventually gave Prince to the Ehardt's because they needed a watch dog like Prince for their farm [64A].</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">After Prince we yearned for another dog, so Grandpa, Frank and I went to the Anti-Cruelty Society on Grand Avenue in Chicago to select a new puppy that we named Brownie. &nbsp;Regrettably, Brownie was not a healthy puppy. &nbsp;We found it necessary to return him to the Anti-Cruelty Society, and did not bring home another puppy. &nbsp;So sad.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">In the late 1940s, Grandpa found a beautiful tan and white fluffy puppy wandering on Illinois Central property where Grandpa and Frank worked. &nbsp;The puppy turned out to be a Pekingese puppy that we named Tootsie [64A]. &nbsp;She &nbsp;lived a happy, content life for over ten years.</FONT><BR>
