<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Best friend, Leora Groth (Bonvini) [46], and I would attend these dances during the school year. After graduation, Lee and additional friends and I advanced to neighborhood church dances which were held on Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings ... great dance bands.</FONT><BR>

<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">By 1949 and early '50s, we thought we were quite sophisticated (!!) [47] and would attend Sunday evening dances sponsored by the CYO (Catholic Youth Organization) where the elite of the elite would dance! &nbsp;CYO dances were held in the elegant Edgewater Beach Hotel ballroom on Sheridan Road on the north shore and also at the Sheraton Hotel ballroom on Michigan Avenue in Chicago.</FONT><BR>

<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">The orchestras were dreamy and cool ... and that is where I met Ed Ozzie one summer Sunday evening at the Edgewater Beach Hotel, in June 1951. &nbsp;I'll never forget ... the orchestra was playing, &quot;One Enchanted Evening&quot; when Ed asked me to dance, and the rest is history.</FONT><BR>
