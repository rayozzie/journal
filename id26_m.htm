                    <tD  VALIGN=TOP HEIGHT= 1021  WIDTH="333"><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Eventually, in 1913 or 1914 when Grandma was about eighteen years old, it was decided that she would leave Johannesfeld to join her sister Anna in America. &nbsp;At the time, Anna lived in a German ethnic section of Chicago, in the North Avenue and Wells Avenue area. &nbsp;She worked as a maid.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Grandma left Germany on a ship, the S.S. Maria Theresa, traveling with a few people from her home town whose names are unknown. &nbsp;The trip was long but exciting; she was going to America! &nbsp;The journey ended when the ship arrived at Ellis Island in New York City.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">After Grandma went through immigration at Ellis Island, she boarded a train to Chicago and then was met by her sister, Anna, in Chicago. &nbsp;How brave of Grandma to accomplish these matters by herself, leaving her family in Johannesfeld, and sailing on a huge ship to the U.S.A., a country which she knew nothing about except that she heard jobs were plentiful and life was good in America.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">In the busy city of New York, she had to find the train station to buy a train ticket to Chicago. &nbsp;After locating the train, she boarded the train destined for Chicago and finally arrived in Chicago to be with her dear sister, Anna, who sponsored Grandma to come to America.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">The two sisters loved and cared for each other, which was so evident over the years [1]. &nbsp;Grandma and Tante Anna shared a flat in the North Avenue and Wells area and Tante saw to it that Grandma soon got a job as a maid, too.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">When I was old enough to remember, Grandma and I would take long walks from our home at 3341 N. Lakewood Avenue to the area just west of Clark Street, between Diversey and Fullerton. &nbsp;Grandma would proudly point out beautiful Victorian homes where she worked as an &quot;upstairs maid&quot; or as a nanny. &nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">In those days the word nanny was not used. &nbsp;&quot;Taking care of the children&quot; was what they called the profession [2]. &nbsp;There were many lovely Victorian homes in that neighborhood, and it was fun to see where my mom worked when she was a young woman. &nbsp;Oh, what a difference between America and from whence Grandma came!</FONT><BR>
