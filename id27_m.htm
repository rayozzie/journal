                    <tD  VALIGN=TOP HEIGHT= 2394  WIDTH="333"><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Elsewhere in Europe, Grandpa (Francis Xavior Fischer) was born in 1894 in a beautiful little town called au-by-Freising in Bavaria, near Munich, Germany. &nbsp;The town is now called au-Hallertau.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">According to my sister Margaret's recollection of au-Hallertau, the town is a picturesque Bavarian town with window boxed homes overflowing with flowers in summer. The town had its own brewery which provided work for many and outside of the town were fields and fields of hops growing for the good beer. &nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Soon after his birth, Grandpa's grandparents (the Fischers) were asked by Grandpa's mother, Wallburger Fischer, to care for him and to raise him [5]. &nbsp;His mother was very young when he was born, and Grandpa never knew his father, but Grandpa's grandparents gave him a wonderful childhood [6]. &nbsp;His grandmother, who was actually his step-grandmother, played an important part in his early life. &nbsp;His grandfather passed away and grandmother became his total protector and mom.</FONT><BR>

<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Grandpa attended school in au-Hallertau; as he grew and matured, he would enjoy spending time with his friends exploring the Black Forest which was nearby. &nbsp;Grandpa would tell us how he enjoyed snow shoeing and ice skating in winter.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">At twelve or thirteen years of age, Grandpa's wise old grandmother arranged for him to receive schooling for the sheet metal trade. &nbsp;Grandpa was sent away to another village to live with the owner of a metal business and his family. &nbsp;In return for learning the trade, Grandpa would do home- and shop-related chores, a common arrangement in those days.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">This arrangement continued for several years until Grandpa completed his apprenticeship in the metal trade. &nbsp;He was very proud of this accomplishment and valued a trade certificate book which documented each project that Grandpa completed, with the metal shop owner's initials stamped on the appropriate page in the book. &nbsp;The book was proof that he had completed the required work.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Time passed, and Grandpa's mother, Walburger Fischer, married Max Raitt and they had seven children [7,8]: &nbsp;Catherine Raitt Gump, Theresa Raitt Mehringer, Grace Raitt Zirnbauer, Wally Raitt Braun, Mary Raitt Domscheit (Tante Mary), Max Raitt (Jr.) and Joseph Raitt.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Max Raitt (Jr.) had a child, Annie Raitt. &nbsp;In 1955, Tante Mary sponsored her neice Annie to leave Germany and to live in the U.S.A. with Tante and Uncle Julius Domscheit. &nbsp;In 1960, Annie married Horst Gluth [9], becoming Annie Gluth. &nbsp;(Annie also has a brother, Max Raitt (3rd) who presently works for a German airline manufacturing company; his wife's name is Viky and their daughter is Ursula.)</FONT><BR>
