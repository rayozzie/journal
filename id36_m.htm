                    <tD  VALIGN=TOP HEIGHT= 817  WIDTH="333"><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">In early fall each year, Grandpa would drive us to Baroda, Michigan, a small farming community near St. Joseph, Michigan where the their friends, the Ehardts, lived. &nbsp;We would spend the weekend visiting the Ehardts on their tidy little farm.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">They owned a brick bungalow home, a huge barn, acres of vegetables, one cow and calf, one horse, chickens, geese, pigs and goats, too. &nbsp;The Ehardt's daughter, Anne , and son, John, [64] would milk their cow, Bossy, while I watched, and they would show me how all the animals were fed.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">We had fun doing farm chores. &nbsp;In the evening darkness, the three of us would find large potatoes in the field, build a small fire and roast the potatoes until they were dark and crisp. &nbsp;Unbelievably delicious delights - stuck on a small branch and showered with salt!!</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">The outhouse (outside toilet) was not my favorite place to be on the Ehardt's farm, but there were other things that were quite quite memorable. &nbsp;In particular, I was fascinated by the enormously tall windmill near the house which made a wonderful squeaky, clangy sound when the wind turned it.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Outside, we'd pump for drinks of water - so cold and so good! &nbsp;Since the Ehardts did not have inside plumbing, water for drinking, cooking and bathing was provided through a small hand pump which was attached to a wooden sink. &nbsp;For bathing, water was pumped into a large pot and heated on the stove.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">One summer I spent a week's vacation on that wonderful farm. &nbsp;What an experience for me!! &nbsp;Anne took a turn visiting us for a week's vacation in the city!! &nbsp;I think she liked farm living better than city living.</FONT><BR>
