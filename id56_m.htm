<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Grandpa always purchased cars which were at least ten years or more old - absolutely never a new car - and he would repair them and the cars were sold &quot;as good as new&quot;.</FONT><BR>

<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">At one time while working on a car in the garage at Lakewood Avenue, the car was hoisted up on wooden blocks, Grandpa was under the car doing repairs and down the car fell on him. &nbsp;He could barely yell for Grandma who was in the house but someone finally heard his cry and Grandpa was pulled from under the car with a badly injured chest, arm and shoulder. &nbsp;According to Grandma, the doctor was called to the house and Grandpa was heavily bandaged as he sustained serious injuries and needed a lengthy recuperation.</FONT><BR>
