                    <tD  VALIGN=TOP HEIGHT= 1261  WIDTH="333"><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Each day of the week for Grandma was devoted to a different cleaning chore. &nbsp;For instance, on Monday clothes were washed in the old wringer washing machine, and damp clothes were hung to dry.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">No &quot;clothes dryers&quot; in those days; clothing was either hung outside on clothes lines held up with long wooden poles (which supported the lines and kept clothes up and away from the grass), or, in winter, newly washed clothes were dried on lines in the basement. &nbsp;If it was raining, sometimes clothes were hung on the porch.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Towels were always stiff when basement dried, but Grandma had a system of rubbing dry bath towels with her fingers until they were somewhat soft again.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">In the 1930s when Grandma and Tante Mary washed living room and dining room curtains, they would use a gadget called a &quot;curtain stretcher&quot;. &nbsp;The curtain stretcher could be adjusted to fit various sizes of curtains and was a wooden frame with delicate nails protruding from around the entire area of the square frame so that curtain fabric was stretched to fit frame and nails.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">It was tedious work to place the fabric carefully onto each tiny nail around the frame but in this way, dry curtains would hang reasonably well again on windows. &nbsp;In the late 1940s, nylon became the preferred fabric for curtains - no more curtain stretchers.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Tuesday was a day of ironing, and I believe Wednesday was either a shopping day for Grandma or sometimes a Kaffee Klatching day with her friends and nearby cousins.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Thursday was a cleaning day as well as Friday when the kitchen and bathroom floors were washed. &nbsp;After those floors were washed, newspaper was spread on the floors and the family had to walk on newspaper until Saturday afternoon so the floors would stay clean for the weekend in the event we had visitors.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Grandma would always bake a cake either on Friday or Saturday. &nbsp;Grandma's cake making was made easier with the advent of the Mixmaster electric mixer in the late 1930s. &nbsp;After Margaret's Mixmaster gift to her, Grandma no longer needed to beat cake dough with a wooden spoon for endless minutes to keep the dough delicate. &nbsp;She would simply plug the cord of this miracle machine into a kitchen wall outlet and would watch the dough whirl around in the bowl until ready for baking.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Other handy conveniences like the pop-up toaster, an electric Sunbeam coffee maker, a vacuum cleaner (no more old fashioned carpet sweeper for our Mom) were gifts to our mother as the years went on.</FONT><BR>
