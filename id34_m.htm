<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Tante was Grandpa's half-sister and was about twenty-five years old at the time. &nbsp;Grandpa and Grandma became her sponsors - the sponsors of a new immigrant. &nbsp;Tante Mary, who then became my godmother, lived with us, and Grandma helped Tante find a job. &nbsp;She found work as a maid for wealthy families. &nbsp;At that time, many immigrant European women were able to find good employment in housekeeping jobs. </FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">When Tante Mary was twenty-seven, she met Uncle JuliusDomscheit and they were soon married [34]. &nbsp;Tante's wedding dress was short, up to her knees, and the dress fabric appears to be green satin. &nbsp;The style was typically &quot;flapper&quot; of the late 1920s and early '30s.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Uncle Julius worked for the Chicago Tribune until his retirement. &nbsp;He was foreman of the department at the Tribune where huge rolls of paper were carried off boats coming from Canadian paper mills. &nbsp;The boats were docked next to the Chicago Tribune Tower building on the Chicago River.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">After they married, Tante Mary and Uncle Julius moved to the second floor of our home at 3341 N. Lakewood Avenue. &nbsp;Their daughter, Marion, was born in 1932 and Marion and I as cousins had fun, fun, fun, growing up together [35]. &nbsp;Tante and Uncle bought their first home in about 1940 and moved to Greenview Avenue in Chicago, about three or four miles from us on Lakewood Avenue.</FONT><BR>

<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Uncle Henry was a barber by trade and worked at a barber shop but he also had a barber chair in their basement and owned all the convenient barber equipment of that time and would cut hair right there in the basement. &nbsp;Uncle Henry would always cut Grandpa's hair and my brother, Frank's hair, and mine too, on those visits to the Martins in the 1930s.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">They were a happy family and we always had good times together. &nbsp;Tante Anna and Grandma [36] were great cooks and we always had a feast of fresh vegetables from Tante's vegetable garden next to their home.</FONT><BR>
