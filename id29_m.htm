<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">On one occasion, Grandpa and a buddy were in at a bar in Marseilles, France, when someone gave him a drugged drink. &nbsp;When Grandpa awakened he was on a ship heading for Algeria, North Africa ... his destination: the French Foreign Legion.</FONT><BR>
<bR>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Tms Rmn">Life in the French Foreign Legion at that time was horrifying. &nbsp;I do not know how long he was in the Foreign Legion, but Grandpa and several other men had apparently had just about enough, and one night managed to escape. &nbsp;The Foreign Legion troops on horseback went looking for them in the desert with guns and knives. &nbsp;Some of the escapees were captured or were killed, but Grandpa and a few others managed to get away. &nbsp;Eventually, they found their way (by foot) to a coastal town. &nbsp;Grandpa located a German ship at port, told his story, and was able to secure employment on the ship - eventually returning safely to Germany [13].</FONT><BR>
